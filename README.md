# GenGuard
(MFA) is implemented to improve access control security in various organizations. Each user is required to create an account and upload a profile picture of their face. This image is processed using an API that verifies the presence of exactly one face. After successful account creation, a unique QR code is generated for the user. This QR code allows access to secure facilities only after the system administrator has granted access privileges to the user. When a user tries to enter the secure facility, they must scan their QR code. The system then knows which face to look for and compares the live image to the one in the database to verify its identity, above certain match percentages the user's entry is approved. Additional security measures include a touch sensor that disables the entry mechanism and activates an alarm if it senses contact. Surveillance cameras installed on the roof of the facility are also used to monitor and track moving objects in the environment.
